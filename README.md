# Foundamentals of Biology to master for learning bioinformatics.


## Biological concepts to master

1. What are chromosomes, DNAs and genes? How are they related?

2. Central dogma: how genetic info flows from DNA to proteins?

3. What is transcription? What is translation?

4. For a given organism such as a mouse or a human being, the genetic materials i.e. DNA of all the cells are almost the same. So, why do different tissues have so disparate cell types and functions? Understand that the differences among tissues are shaped by the different gene transcription networks: different tissues have the same set of genes, but their "working" (or "expressed", "active") genes were different.

5. Understand exons and introns.

6. Understand alternative splicing (AS). Through AS, a single multi-exon gene can produce multiple different isoforms that may have different sequences, structures and functions. So, a single gene may produce multiple transcript isoforms and further multiple protein isoforms.

7. RNA-seq, DNA-seq
